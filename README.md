## Rationale

**Project RPG** is a browser-based memory battle game where players choose a hero, face a series of increasingly powerful monsters, and advance through story-driven encounters. The goal is to train memory, reaction, and strategy skills in a fun RPG format.  

This project was inspired by classic fantasy role-playing adventures combined with the mechanics of pattern recognition games (similar to *Simon Says*). By blending **interactive storytelling**, **dynamic battles**, and **accessible gameplay**, it creates a light but immersive experience for both casual players and RPG fans.

Unlike generic memory games, Project RPG integrates:
- **Character selection** with portraits and stats,  
- **Monster battles** with unique abilities and health,  
- **Difficulty modes** (Easy, Medium, Hard),  
- **Dynamic story cutscenes**,  
- **High score saving** via `localStorage`.

## Project Vision & Inspiration

The game builds on the love of **fantasy RPGs** and **tabletop adventures like Dungeons & Dragons**. Leon, the developer, wanted to combine interactive storytelling with accessible browser-based play.

Key inspirations:
- D&D campaign battles with story beats at milestones.  
- RPG tropes (heroes, goblins, orcs, dragons).  
- Classic memory/pattern games adapted with RPG visuals.  

The result: a **fun, lightweight RPG memory trainer** with a branching narrative and replayability through difficulty levels.
