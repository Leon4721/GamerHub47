Project Rationale – Rhythm & Sigil

Developed by CD Projekt Noir

Introduction

Rhythm & Sigil is an interactive RPG-inspired memory battle game that fuses the mechanics of rhythm and pattern recall with the immersive storytelling of fantasy role-playing games. Drawing creative influence from Baldur’s Gate 3, Skyrim, Elden Ring and RuneScape, the game distills the essence of large-scale RPG combat into a streamlined, accessible browser experience.

The project was conceived as both a creative homage to the RPG genre and a personal exploration of inclusivity within fantasy storytelling. Too often, fantasy worlds underrepresent minority groups or present them in narrow ways. Rhythm & Sigil addresses this gap by featuring a diverse cast of heroes, including strong representation of POC characters, so that players of different cultural backgrounds can see themselves reflected in a genre that has historically lacked this inclusivity.

This approach ensures that the game is not only fun and immersive but also socially meaningful — a reminder that fantasy worlds should be as diverse as the real one.

## Game Lore

At the start of Rhythm & Sigil, the player steps into the role of a chosen hero. As Galihad, the male Knight, your bride-to-be has been stolen by goblin raiders. As Eva, the female Elf warrior, it is your tribal sister who has been taken. What begins as a personal rescue quickly reveals a deeper evil at work.

The goblins are not acting alone—they serve a cunning Dark Mage, whose forbidden sorcery binds both goblins and orcs to her will. Each battle draws you closer to her fortress, where illusions and traps mask the true scale of her corruption. What feels like a rescue mission becomes a desperate fight against spreading darkness.

From facing endless waves of goblins, to dueling orc warlords, the journey culminates in a confrontation with the dreaded Skeleton Knight, a fallen champion reanimated by necromancy. Defeating him reveals the Mage’s ultimate weapon—an ancient dragon, a living force of elemental fire and destruction.

This unfolding narrative transforms a simple quest of love and loyalty into a true RPG epic, where the player discovers that every choice carries weight, every victory uncovers hidden truths, and only courage can overcome the rising tide of shadow.

## Project Goals  

The goal of "R & S" is to build a **fantasy-themed memory game** that is:  
- Engaging, story-driven, and visually immersive.  
- Accessible and responsive across modern devices.  
- Educational in the sense of memory training, while entertaining through story driven battles.  

### User Goals

## Design  

### Colour Scheme  
We chose a dark-fantasy base with gold accents because it echoes classic RPG visual language: torchlit dungeons, treasure glint, “legendary” rarity frames. Green for player HP and red/orange for enemy damage mirrors D&D, Diablo, Baldur’s Gate, and MMO HUDs. Blue (arcane/mage), purple (archer/BeastMastery), red (warrior/strength), and Green (healer/druid) map to long-standing class color conventions, so actions are instantly readable—even for players coming from rhythm/improv memory games like Simon. High-contrast grey highlights call out each pattern without confusion. The palette also meets accessibility needs (contrast and label redundancy), keeping the screen legible on small devices while preserving an RPG atmosphere.

The Color Pallet used was made on [adobe.com](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/)
<img src=/docs/cwheel.jpeg></details>

- **Dark fantasy palette** with gold highlights.  
- Player HP: green gradient.  
- Monster HP: red/orange gradient.  
- Modal backgrounds: semi-transparent black for immersion.  
- Accent gold (#ffcc00) for buttons and key highlights.  

### Fonts  
- `Segoe UI` for clean readability.  
- Bold headings with fantasy feel using strong shadows.  

### Structure  
The website consists of 4 main pages:  
1. **Index Page** – Character selection and difficulty modal.  
2. **Game Page** – Main battle screen, help modal, and story modal.  
3. **Contact Page** – Feedback form with validation.  
4. **404 Page** – Fantasy-themed error page with return link.
  
The site is organised so players can learn fast and move smoothly between key views. Core UI patterns (title area, HUD, action strip, floating help/contact) remain consistent to reduce cognitive load.

Screens & overlays included:

Title / Character Select
Players enter a hero name, browse character cards, and start their journey. The page also exposes quick audio controls and a floating contact link. A shared Story overlay can appear here after selection to set the scene.

Main Battle
The playfield displays a compact HUD with Level/Mode (circular badge) plus Round/Score, flanked by matching Player and Monster frames with semantic health bars. Primary controls (Start Battle and Replay Pattern) sit above a 2×2 action grid (Archer/Mage/Warrior/Healer) with printed key hints (1–4). A floating “?” opens the How-to-Play dialog; Story scenes can also overlay between levels. A persistent Contact button is available.

How-to-Play (modal overlay)
Available on the battle screen via the “?” button, this modal explains the sequence/response loop, keyboard controls, healing rules, and tips. It supports Esc to close, backdrop click, and focus return for accessibility.

Story (modal overlay)
Narrative cards (image, text, choice buttons) punctuate progression—after levels, at forks, on victory/defeat—and are shared between the title and game pages for consistency.

Contact
A dedicated page provides a styled form with client validation, a honeypot field, polite status updates, a confirm/error modal, and a smart Return action (back or home). EmailJS integration is wired for sending.

404 Error Page
A themed not-found screen keeps players inside the experience and offers a clear route back to the Home page. 

Shared elements across screens:

Top audio controls for SFX and music (toggle states, visible slash when music is off).

Responsive container sizing and aspect-ratio cards to keep all critical UI on-screen on mobile without scrolling.

This structure keeps navigation predictable: players start at Character Select, battle through the Main screen with help/story overlays as needed, reach out via Contact if required, and land on a friendly 404 if they stray.
